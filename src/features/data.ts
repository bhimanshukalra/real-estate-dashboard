The layout is simple and honest, with north facing windows pulling the light into the lounge room.

Nine Mile Beach and Redhead are only 10 minutes away, and if you're into the outdoors, weekends can be spent exploring the 4WD tracks at Belmont Wetlands or cycling the Fernleigh Track all the way to Adamstown or Swansea.\n\n- Approx block dimensions 14.63m/ 13.11m X 39.22m / 42.14m, zoned R2 \n- Classic three bedroom home in tidy, original condition\n- Kitchen with electric cooking\n- Single carport and double garage at rear of block\n- Floraville Public school 1.1km, Belmont High 1.8km\n- Belmont 16s 2.7km, Eleebana boat ramp 6.7km, Warners Bay cafes 8.5km\n- Approx. 13 min drive to Charlestown Square, 25 minutes to Newcastle city centre\n- All building work subject to approval from Lake Macquarie Council\n\n* This information, including but not limited to photographs (which may show boundaries), copywriting, floorplans, and site plans, has been prepared solely for the purpose of marketing this property.
